Why

I'm taking this class as my first step towards persuing a career in web development. I've taken programing classes in college and have read books and articles on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have a strong interest in technology and the web. I really want to get my head wrapped around how to build user friendly, attractive websites. I am also interested in learning about what technologies and techniques go into creating cutting edge websites. Learning where web developers go to get answers to questions they have or when they are stuck is also of interest to me. I also want to know where I should go to keep up with new developments in FEWD and the web in general.
